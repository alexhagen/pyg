Pyg - a Python Graphing Library
===============================

Pyg - pronounced 'pig' is my own personal graphing library for ``python``. If
you haven't read the short introduction
`here <http://alexhagen.github.io/pyg/>`_, you might want to.  It will explain to
you if you actually want to use this library for whatever you're planning to do.
There are very few caveats to reading this documentation, but something to keep
in mind is that I wrote very little actual graphing for this library, just
wrapped ``matplotlib`` in a way that made things easier and more repeatable (and
prettier, too).  Good luck and happy coding!
