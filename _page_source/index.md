`pyg` (pronounced <i>pig</i>) is my graphing library for `python`, building off of
`matplotlib`.  Realistically, it only is very useful for a couple cases.

- If you're using my [`pym`](http://alexhagen.github.io/pym/) library for
interpolation, decimation, or other operations on data sets, `pyg` is a lazy
and easy way to create graphs from these objects.
- If you've got a specific style in mind, and you want to pass that in as an
`rc.Params` object, `pyg` can help you keep that style consistent.
- If you're wanting to publish, `pyg` has some exporting features that make
figures exported as <i>1-column</i>, <i>2-column</i>, or <i>full-page</i> look
great in journal articles.
- If you want to tinker, `pyg` is a good starting point for making functions
to consistently graph data with the same annotations, such as measurements,
data-pointers, and other features.

If one of those cases are something you're interested in, you can look below
for samples and demos or take a look at the [documentation](docs/).
